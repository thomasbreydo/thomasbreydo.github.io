I'm a tech lover who's also super into math and science. I figured out my love for programming when I was nine years
old, coding in Python for fun. Since then, I've taught myself coding languages like C++, Java, and Go through various [projects](/projects/)
and online courses.

If I'm not coding, I'm probably learning something new or spending time with family and friends.
