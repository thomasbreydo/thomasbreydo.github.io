I'm a tech lover who's also super into math and science. I figured out my love for programming when I was nine years
old, coding in Python for fun.

Since then, I've taught myself coding languages like C++, Java, and Go through various [projects](/projects/)
and online courses.

Recently, I began to study CS theory in school. I'm really enjoying

$$f^{-1}(x)+\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^x\mathrm dx$$
