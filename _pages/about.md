I'm a tech lover who's also super into math and science. I figured out my love for programming when I was nine years
old, coding in Python for fun.

Since then, I've taught myself coding languages like C++, Java, and Go through various [projects](/projects/)
and online courses.

This year, I began to study the theory of computation
(Turing machines, decidability, P vs. NP, complexity theory, and so on). It's a cool
blend between math and programming. Check out one of the proofs I wrote
[here]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdfs/SAT_reduces_to_VERTEX_COVER.pdf).
