I wanted to have a light outside of my room that indicated whether I was busy or not.
Of course, I didn't settle for any old light: I wanted a smart light that I could
control remotely. But that wasn't enough &hellip; I wanted to _automate_ this light.

In order to write scripts for the light, I needed to design a CLI for interacting
with it. I chose to write it in Go, which is a blazing-fast language with a great
CLI library called [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra).

The project was fun and incredibly useful, though my family disregards the light sometimes ;)
